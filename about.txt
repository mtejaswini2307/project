My name is Tejaswini from Bsc.data science-2.
One key thing I learned about GitHub is that it’s not just for storing code — it’s also a collaboration platform.
It uses Git version control so multiple people can work on the same project at once, track changes, review code, and merge contributions without overwriting each other’s work.
